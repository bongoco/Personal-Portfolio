# Personal-Portfolio
Feel free to edit the files to your own preferences and create a similarily-styled personal site.

## Getting Started
Download the files, unzip, and view the HTML file in your preferred browser.

## To Edit
### Text
Open the HTML in your preferred text editor and change the caption under "welcome-section" into your name.<br>
The headers can be edited by changing ```h1``` and descriptions at ```p```.
### Pictures
I used [PostImage](https://postimages.org/) to host my images.<br>
Links can be changed within the ```img``` tags. Flexbox and grid will take care of the rest.
